### 🧠 About Me

Hi, I’m Kisha, but in the gaming world I go by 4rudy (you will see commits under this handle).
I’m a self-taught developer who builds clean, structured systems with a player-first mindset.
I specialize in Lua-based gameplay logic, UI systems, and backend scripting for FiveM.
Right now, I’m focused on expanding my portfolio with modular features like pet systems, shops, and job mechanics — all designed to be scalable, immersive, and future-proof.

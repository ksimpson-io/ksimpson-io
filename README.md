### 🧠 About Me

My name is Kisha but in the gaming world I go by 4rudy. I'm a self-taught dev who writes clean, structured systems with a player-first mindset.  
I specialize in Lua-based gameplay logic, UI systems, and backend scripting for **FiveM**.  
Currently building out my portfolio with modular features like pet systems, shops, and job mechanics — all scalable and future-proof.

# 👋 Hey, I'm Kisha (4rudy)

I'm a gameplay-focused developer building modular, optimized systems for FiveM and beyond.  
I love writing clean Lua logic, crafting smooth UI experiences, and making things that feel good to use.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

- 🧠 **Lua** – My strongest language, used for gameplay, logic, and framework-level scripting
- ⚙️ **FiveM (QBCore/Ox)** – Building immersive systems from pet companions to shop frameworks
- 🖼️ **UI** – ox_lib contexts, context-aware menus, and front-end polish
- 💾 **SQL / oxmysql** – Persistent data storage with clean schema design

### 📌 Featured Repos

Here are a few systems I've created or maintained:

- [`fivem-petsystem`](https://github.com/ksimpson-io/fivem-petsystem) – Modular pet companion system with shops, tricks, UI, and AI logic

### 🎯 Goals

- Break into the game dev industry, starting with strong systems and FiveM work
- Learn Unreal Engine & C++ while building gameplay systems
- Stay focused on clean, expandable codebases — not spaghetti
